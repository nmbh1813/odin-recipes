        <h2>Smoothies</h2>

            <p>
                Concocted by me when I started to feel like a bad mother who didn't feed her
                child enough veggies! So delicious it's hard to believe that it is healthy!
                <br><br>
                Makes 2 small smoothies. Or one big one!
                <br><br>
                TIP: When your fruits (and some veggies) look like they're about to go bad and you
                know you're not going to be able to eat it all -- chop it up and freeze it for smoothies!
            </p>
